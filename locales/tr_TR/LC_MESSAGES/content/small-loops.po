"The most convenient geometrical arrangement for the field analysis of a "

"In the analysis of radiation problems, the usual procedure is to specify "
"the sources and then require the fields radiated by the sources. It is a "
"very common practice in the analysis procedure to introduce auxiliary "
"functions, known as vector potentials, which will aid in the solution of "
"the problems. The most common vector potential functions are the "
":math:`A` (magnetic vector potential) and :math:`F` (electric vector "
"potential). While it is possible to determine the :math:`E` and :math:`H`"
" fields directly from the source-current densities :math:`J` and "
":math:`M`, as shown in "
":numref:`geometrical_arrangement_for_loop_antenna_analysis`, it is "
"usually much simpler to find the auxiliary potential functions first and "
"then determine the :math:`E` and :math:`H`. This two-step procedure is "
"also shown in :numref:`geometrical_arrangement_for_loop_antenna_analysis`"
" :cite:`balanis:2005`."

"For comparable performance, it appears that the length of the ferrite "
"core must be roughly equal to the diameter of an equivalent air loop. "
"However, other dimensions are smaller; that is, an air loop must be "
"“large” in two dimensions, whereas a ferrite loop need be large in only "
"one. The net result is a packaging advantage for the ferrite loop, "
"somewhat less electrostatic pick-up than that for the air loop, and a "
"structurally simpler device to electrostatically shield, if desired "
"[Stewart, 1958]. The static measuring technique enables reasonably valid "
"data to be accumulated at a rapid rate such that tests of ferrite-cored "
"antennas covering a whole range of parameters can be obtained on a modest"
" budget [Stewart, 1958]."

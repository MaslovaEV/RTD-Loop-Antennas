"A surface, near or on an antenna, on which it is convenient to make "
"assumptions regarding the field values for the purpose of computing "
"fields at external points. **Note**: The aperture is often taken as that "
"portion of a plane surface near the antenna, perpendicular to the "
"direction of maximum radiation, through which the major part of the "
"radiation passes :cite:`ieee145:1993`."

"The power received by an antenna can be described in terms of a "
"collecting area known as the effective aperture. This may be associated "
"with a physical aperture but even a linear wire antenna can be described "
"in terms of a notional collecting area. If the electromagnetic field has "
"a power density of :math:`P_d`, and the receiving antenna has an "
"effective aperture of :math:`A_e` then it will capture a power of "
":math:`P_d A_e`. The effective area depends only on the wavelength of the"
" radiation and the directivity or gain :cite:`gibson:2010`."

"In electrical engineering and telecommunications the Chu–Harrington limit"
" or Chu limit sets a lower limit on the Q factor for a small radio "
"antenna. The theorem was developed in several papers between 1948 and "
"1960 by Lan Jen Chu, Harold Wheeler, and later by Roger Harrington. The "
"definition of a small antenna is one that can fit inside a sphere of "
"radius :math:`k^{-1}`, where :math:`k=2\\pi /\\lambda` is the wavenumber."
" For a small antenna the Q is proportional to the reciprocal of the "
"volume of a sphere that encloses it. In practice this means that there is"
" a limit to the bandwidth of data that can be sent to and received from "
"small antennas such as are used in mobile phones."

"More specifically, Chu established the limit on Q for a lossless antenna "
"as :math:`Q\\geq {\\frac {1}{k^{3}a^{3}}}+{\\frac {1}{ka}}}` for a linear"
" polarized antenna, where :math:`a` a is the radius of the smallest "
"sphere containing the antenna and its current distribution. A circular "
"polarized antenna can be half the size. (an extension of the theory of "
"Chu by Harrington). As antennas are made smaller, the bandwidth shrinks "
"and radiation resistance becomes smaller compared to loss resistances "
"that may be present, thus reducing the radiation efficiency. For users "
"this decreases the bitrate, limits range, and shortens battery life. "
